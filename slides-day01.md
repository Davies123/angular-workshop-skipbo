# [fit] Skip-Bo Core
# & Oscar üêô

^ You will find a package `skipbo-core`. That's the whole SkipBo game implemented and tested and it runs basically headless. This will save you A LOT of time. Yes it's interesting implementing a set of game rules but you won't get many different challenges from it. That's why I did this for you!
