# Lessions

## Lazy Loading
Create a lazy loaded module (`GameModule`) together with a first page (`GameCompomnent`). Load it with your application router. If you see the page it works. Use the CLI.

Challenges:
+ Create a production build and compare before and after.
+ Use webpack analyzer to see the difference

```
ng g module skipbo --routing
ng g c skipbo/skipbo
```
