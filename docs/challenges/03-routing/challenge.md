# Routing

## Your challenge
You are in this branch to start: `workshop/03-routing-start` and you should see the following screen.

![](start.png)

That's basically where we stopped in the last challenge but I made some additions. You actually see only one visual change: There is a footer with some links which are not working. In the sources you will notice some new components mainly to be displayed as pages (like Gameover, Rulebook etc).

I also extended the `PlayerService` and `GameService` to build a bridge to the `Skipbo Core` I prepared for the workshop which included the whole game logic to play the game without any visual representation ‚Äî that's what we are building here üí™ If you are interested in how I implemented the Skip-Bo Core you can checkout the sources (bundled in the workshop) after the Workshop and also ask me questions anytime.

In the past two challenges we created something that already felt like a card game, it's now time to make it an game application by providing different pages where the user is welcomed, where he can read the rules, configure and start a game. Of course the actually playing and a gameover page should also be included.

## Install Routes
I already added and registered all page components and prefillde them with content. But it's your duty to install the router. I created the routing modules `app-routing.module.ts` and `game/game-routing.module.ts` for you ‚Äî now fill them and fix the specs, they will tell you what to do.

![](specs.png)

Are you done? Nice! Now take a look at all the pages you have created.

+ [WelcomePage](http://localhost:4200/): A warm welcome to the player
+ [Game Start Page](http://localhost:4200/game/start): The start page to set how many players will take part in the game. Notice that we block the start button to ensure at least two player and also a name for yourself.

+ [Game](http://localhost:4200/game/play): The game itself
+ [Gameover](http://localhost:4200/game/gameover): The page to display after the game over.
+ [Rulebook](http://localhost:4200/game/rules): All you need to know about playing the game.


## Lazy Loading
Switch to branch `workshop/03-routing-progress-01` to catch up.

### Disable Specs
Find file `test-routes.spec.ts` and disable all tests by replacing the first describe with the following:

```typescript
xdescribe('workshop routing', () => {
```

We are going to break those tests so I would like to disable them.

### Remove GameModule
We want to lazy load the module. The first thing to do is removing the GameModule reference from your application module imports. That way nothing is imported during compile time.

You will notice the following error:

> ERROR Error: StaticInjectorError(AppModule)[AppComponent -> GameService]:

We have a leftover from our first challenge (modules). Can you spot the problem?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  It's the Injectable decorator. We removed the `provideIn` flag at some point and imported the service manually in the game module. Without a module providing the service and the lack of the GameModules the injector can't find the class. You can fix it with like so:

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class GameService {
```

You could also just remove the injection in the `app.component` as we won't need it at this place anymore.

</details>


### Load it
You want to load the game module now. Use the path `game` and figure out the path for loadChildren yourself. Work in the file `app-routing.module`. You know that the module is processed as a separate chunk and saved to be loaded later if you check your shell. You should see a new chunk appearing:

![](new-chunk.png)

The large size of `446 kB` is coming from the `StartComponent` as it's using the FormModule. Because we are not using the form modules anywhere else that's what we are saving now when the application initially loaded the welcome page. It's only loaded when the user decides to interact with the game.

Now check your browser. Can you navigate to [http://localhost:4200/game](http://localhost:4200/game) by clicking on the Start Button on the welcome page? It's not working, somehow the content is not displayed. But we are sure that we have placed the necessary `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` in the `game.component.html` and we only changed the module from loading eager to lazy loading.

That must be a bug in Angular ‚Äî or can you find the mistake ?

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  You added the following route in the application router to lazy load the GameModule. Didn't you ?

```typescript
{
  path: 'game', loadChildren...
}
```

At the same time your `GameRoutingModule` contains this:

```typescript
export const routes: Routes = [
{
path: 'game', component: GameComponent,
//...
```

  You are actually nesting the route two times and your game is mounted here: [http://localhost:4200/game/game](http://localhost:4200/game/game).

  With those information you should be able to fix it üí™

</details>

Did you fix it? Well done!

## Guard the game
Start here if you want to catch up: `workshop/03-routing-progress-02`.

At the moment you can navigate straight to the game by open the url [http://localhost:4200/game/play](http://localhost:4200/game/play). This works because there is no real logic yet involved ‚Äî but in reality you want to have full control about whether a route can be opened. That way you can ensure

+ That a user is authenticated
+ Maybe some necessary data for the page being loaded is available
+ That your application state is in a known state (here we have the problem: who configured the players when skipping the start dialog?)

The good news is, you have already learned how to handle those situations which brings us to the next task.

**Your task:**
Guard the game and prevent it from loading if the the game is not yet started. Use the flag `started` in the GameService and create the guard.

Start with the Angular CLI and generate a guard without specs (as you get a prepared one soon).

```
ng g guard game/guards/game --spec=false
```

Now copy over the spec file helping you to implement the guard. Use the following command or copy an rename the file from.

```
cp src/app/workshop-files/game.guard src/app/game/guards/game.guard.spec.ts
```

Ensure your specs are running (restart if you still see 0 tests) and you get three failing specs.

![](spec2.png)
You will implement the guard by fixing those errors. Continue reading first. To enable the just created guard, pass it to the route you want to protect (work in file `game-routing.module.ts`)

```typescript
{
  path: 'play', component: GameplayComponent,
  canActivate: [ GameGuard ]
},
```

Now you have a guard which implements the `CanActivate` interface (that's the default for the generator you used). From here use the official [documentation](https://angular.io/api/router/CanActivate) and the information from the theory part to complete your task.

> **Hint:** When activation fails, the guard should manually redirect to a fallback location (use '/welcome'). If you don't do this, the router will stop when you try navigation to `/game/play` and display an empty page.

Continue from here When you're done.


So all tests are green? You should now **not** be able to open the page [http://localhost:4200/game/play](http://localhost:4200/game/play) directly. You will be redirected to [/welcome](http://localhost:4200/game/play). If you properly start from the welcome page [/game/start](http://localhost:4200/game/start) page you can enter the game again.

That's exactly what we wanted to achieve. Done! Your game is now guarded üõ°üëä

### CanDeactivate
Checkout branch `workshop/03-routing-progress-04` as I have added some more specs to fulfill.

Let us add another guard. We want to protect our users from leaving a game by mistake by navigating to the previous page. We can do this by providing a CanDeactivate guard. To add a `CanDeactivate` guard you have to implement the interface `CanDeactivate` in your class. We will further extend our existing GameGuard. Look into the file `game.guard.ts`. You will see that I have already prepared everything so that you can implement it.

Take notice that CanDeactivate receives a generic and that we pass in the GameplayComponent (`CanDeactivate<GameplayComponent>`).

```typescript
export class GameGuard implements CanActivate, CanDeactivate<GameplayComponent>
```

This is required because the guard will be called together with a reference to the currently mounted component. This enables you to check back with the component if we can leave. The method currently looks like this:

```typescript
canDeactivate(component: GameplayComponent): boolean {
  return false;
}
```

Implement it and turn the specs green again.
![](specs3.png)

canUserLeave on the component will check if the game is over ‚Äî if yes we are fine to leave if not we will show a native confirm dialog to ask the user for confirmation. `window.confirm` is script blocking, so you can use the return value like it's coming from a synchronous method call.

Congratulations ‚Äî your completed another challenge üèÖüçª
