# Components

## Your challenge
You are in this branch to start: `workshop/02-components-start`

I'm sorry, your project is still blank but I promise we will change this.

![Blank Project](blank-project.png)

Ensure your Application is still running under 4200 and that your specs are running too.

You will create

`pages/gameplay` to hold our game stage
a card image
a card 
and a pile

## Components all over
Create (again: use the Angular CLI) those components:
(`ng g c games/...`)

game/pages/gameplay
game/components/card
game/components/card-face
game/components/card-pile


All those components have been automatically added to the `GameModule` (take a look, field `declarations`). This means they can use each other ‚Äî as all of them are inside the module. But if you want to use it outside you have to export the component.

## I won't export. Proof it!
So you don't believe me, let's try to use one of the component first outside then inside to see the difference.

Add the following markup to your `app.component.html` (which is empty at the momemt).

```
<skipbo-gameplay></skipbo-gameplay>
```

Save it and watch what happens in your browser.

> Uncaught Error: Template parse errors:
'skipbo-gameplay' is not a known element:<br>
1. If 'skipbo-gameplay' is an Angular component, then verify that it is part of this module.<br>
2. If 'skipbo-gameplay' is a Web Component then add 'CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA' to the '@NgModule.schemas' of this component to suppress this message. ("[ERROR ->]<skipbo-gameplay></skipbo-gameplay>")

Well that's what I said. It won't work. We can fix it in two ways ‚Äî just like the error message tells us.

## Web Components
Put the following line into your `app.module.ts`.

```
@NgModule({
	//...
	schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]
})
export class AppModule { }
```
The error magically disappears but you won't see any content from the the Gameplay Component you wanted to mount. We just told Angular that it should ignore all tags with dashes case (see [reference](https://angular.io/api/core/CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA)) which is required to use self-bootstrapping Angular Elements or any other Web Component implementation. We are not using a web component here so this is clearly not our solution.

Remember:
> You have to use CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA to surpress Angular error regarding unknown html tags when using Web Components & Angular Elements

## Export
Remove the schema entry from the application module so you see the error again. Now do this:

Open file `game.module.ts` and provide `GameplayComponent` in the exports array like so:

```
@NgModule({
  ///...
  exports: [
    GameplayComponent
  ]
})
export class GameModule { }

```

Did it work? Indeed, you should see this üí™

## Private Components
Let's try to use a component inside that GameplayComponent. 

Put this into `gameplay.component.html`

```
<skipbo-card-pile></skipbo-card-pile>
<skipbo-card-pile></skipbo-card-pile>
```

Does it work ? Yes again! 
![card-pile-works](card-pile-works.png)

We did not export `CardPileComponent` and still it works. That's because both components `GameplayComponent` and `CardPileComponent` are declared (`declarations:[]`) in the same modul (`GameModule`). It's kind of a private/protected component limited to the scope of the module.

We will continue with a slighlty updated branch to save you from writing some scss, html and also some code.

## Cards & Piles
Switch to branch `workshop/02-components-progress-01` to continue. I added some markup and scss to save you that step and to display real cards finally.

### Start the game
The GameService will provide the necessary deck list data ‚Äî but you have to start the game first by calling `start` on the GameService.

Do this in the given `ngOnInit` callback in the GameplayComponent. Your screen should look like this if it's working and you can continue.

### Fix the bug
There is a bug when you interact with the build and back button. Look at the height of the piles. Can you identify what's wrong and can you fix it ?

> **Tip:** Watch for two failing specs

## Inject Parent Example
A good programmer creates only loosely coupled systems. You learn this for a good reason as it makes your code more maintainable.

The main method of doing so in React for exampels is by passing data, functions, references and even children with properties (which equals the composition pattern).

Angular is a different framework and we have different ways of doing so. Services, Events and Injection in general.

You can not only inject Services but Components and Directives from your DOM tree.

Let's try a quick example with no real usage yet. Throw in the following constructor into the CardComponent:

```
constructor(
    @Host() @Optional() pile: CardPileComponent
  ) {

    if (pile) {
      console.log('Card says: My parent pile is', pile);
    } else {
      console.log('Card says: I Have no parent pile');
    }
  }
```

When you watch your console you will see plenty of those messages:
> Card says: My parent pile is **CardPileComponent**<br>
> Card says: My parent pile is **CardPileComponent**<br>
> Card says: My parent pile is **CardPileComponent**<br>
> Card says: My parent pile is **CardPileComponent**<br>
> ...

So that worked.  Now temporarily replace the whole gameplay template with the following html.

```
<skipbo-card face="-1"></skipbo-card>
```

The log shrinks to this:

> Card says: I have no parent pile

The card can really detect if there is a parent pile. We just proofed it by looking at the logs.

That host injecting mechanic is kind of a tighter coupling but in reality not different to passing in properties ‚Äî so you can absolutely use it when the classic methods are not working or if you would create too much boilercode. That being said: In most cases you shouldn't need such a mechanic as you can simply pass in the information Card is interested in from the parent pile with `@Inputs`.

In other scenarios where you would call methods or bind events oof the parent component you could inject a service in both components to work as the message bus. 

Angular for examples uses the `@Host()` pattern heavily in the forms package to get information about groupings.

You are done. Congratulations üèÖüåü
