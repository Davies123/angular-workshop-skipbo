# Log
I started end of October around 30/31 with the project, as a project ended the plan was to have full 4 weeks to develop the workshop. Luckliy (or unluckily) we got landed a project ‚Äî starting on 21.11 and removing 1.5 weeks from my schedule üòë This means workign on the workshop weekends, before work and after work. But it's a fun challenge and totally worth.

Did I mention I'm also 7 days in London for AngularConnect beginning of Novemeber ? Great planinng by me. See me working in London in some shared workspaces.

+ Research, Research, Research. There must be a Skip-Bo Game in JavaScript ‚Äî which framework doesn't matter. But there isn't. Most games are only rough starters never completed.
+ Before doing nothing, I start with building a Typescript Only, TDD-driven  version of [Skipbo Core](https://github.com/georgiee/skipbo-typescript-jest). This took my around 5 days.
+ TDD with implementing the Game Rules was a beautiful fit. I will use this to show people how powerful TDD can be!
+ Continue with an Angular version. But let's
Integrate the Skipbo Core... no not yet. Search for some game artwork. And there is nothing. Search more. Still nothing. Search again ‚Äî OK I give up, there is nothing I could use so I build myself a set of cards in Sketch

+ Research again for completed implementations. But nothing, there is really nothing.
+ Found the official App of Skip-Bo and I thought I could unpack the Android pkg somehow to get ANY insights. No luck.
+ Back to my Sketch design. I update some designs and layouts ‚Äî as I got soem nice inspiration from the official app.
+ Let's start with implementing the Angular version. It's awesome how good my skipbo-core works as a "backend". This was not planned but its code only nature leaded to maybe.
+ Steady progress with the UI. I also created plenty of other Angular projects called `skipbo`, `skipbo-workshop`, `skipbo-workshop- scratchpad`, `scratchpad`, `playind-draft-no-ui` or simply `lessions`. For what? Because I really need to get my lessions started. There are only three weeks left.
+ I pivoted and started with some lists what I want to teach. I already have a list from the client but it's too huge. So I write a list, shrink it, switch it, delete it to end up with 6 items: modules, components, testing, aniamtion, rxjs & routing. Looks solid.
+ After having such a list I filled six markdown documents with whatever I felt is interesting about the topic. This was a great reflection of what I knew and what I should read about again.
+ Back to the projects, I continue working on building the final prototype and I spent far too much time with animations. But it looked so neat.
+ I run in circles and don't have a clear way of creating the lessions yet. One day the pressure (less than two weeks) is too much: I just create a first lession file. Write down some things I would want to learn about modules. Created a starter project which had all assets and the skipbo-core integrated and started coding. Step by step. Creatign branches for my milestones. That felt good!
+ It looks like I found my working mode. Chapter by chapter (the six topics) I review the theory files I created, and thought about nice things to let people build. I also got the brilliant idea to fast forward code to give the people a feeling of real progress so we can land at the final game that I prototyped. That helped me a lot as I was really blocked on how to make progress over the six chapters. It was important to me that the people can hold a finished game in the hands after six chapters. After figuring out that this was more important than people created every bit of code I was really confident that this will work.
+ I discovered the details & summary html5 tag for my purposes in the workshop to show Hints that are hidden initially.
<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
So cool and useful for workshops üôå
</details>

+ Generate a list of all branches (git branch -a) 49 (üßê) and manually check if all are pushed or force push if necessary)
+ git cherry pick changes across all branches
Found this in skipbo-core after creating ALL branches

```
+import { PlatformRef } from '@angular/core';
+import { executeInitAndContentHooks } from '@angular/core/src/render3/instructions';
```

Cherry picking to the resuce.
+ Here the [completed workshop](https://skipbo-angular-workshop.netlify.com/game/play) branch.

+ Tinkerign around with gifs and videos.
+ Started creating the presentation (less than 7 days) while working on the theory & challenge markdown files.
+ I use Deckset for the presentation so now technlogy gets in my way and I can just use markdown.
+ Refactor structure (separate theory + challenge folder, images moved)
+ Create Slides for Day 1 and Day 2 with Deckset so I can use markdown.
+ Should I do housekeeping across all branches or not ü§î
+ Decided to create previews of all completed challenges with netlify. Again, cherry picking the commit where I provide the necessary _redirect file (to allow pushState).


+ Forgot to create the theory file for components so I'm doign this now after I already finished everything else. Well "finished" we will see.
